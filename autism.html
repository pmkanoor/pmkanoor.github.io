    <p><font size="3" color="black" font face="georgia">Autism is a complex condition that results in impairments in social interactions and communication skills. Most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in everyday human interactions. By ages 8 to 10 months, children with autism show symptoms such as failure to respond to their names, reduced interest in people and delayed babbling. As they develop into toddlers, children with autism struggle with playing social games and prefer to play alone. Additionally, kids with autism have difficulty conveying and regulating feelings. Young children with autism tend to be delayed in skills such as counting and communicating. Also, they have trouble understanding what other people think and feel which disallows them to efficiently express themselves through words, gestures, facial expressions, and touch.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3" color="black" font face="georgia">Daily structure is crucial. It keeps the brain busy and results in stability. Children who have autism catch on quickly with learning routines, and are instinctively driven to repeat them. Once a set routine is established, everyday activities such as learning and interactions with others flows smoother. </font></p>
